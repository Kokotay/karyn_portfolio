                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class="pb-2">
                    My name is Karyn, and I am a graphic design student with a unique background in psychology and
                    English. I have always been fascinated by the way words and images can be used to convey complex
                    ideas and emotions, and I am excited to be pursuing my passion for design as a way to communicate
                    and connect with others.
                    <br>As a new designer, I am constantly exploring new techniques and styles to create work that is
                    both visually striking and emotionally resonant. I believe that design has the power to inspire,
                    inform, and transform the world around us, and I am committed to using my skills to create
                    meaningful experiences for others.

                    <br>One of my key strengths as a designer is my background in psychology. Through my studies, I have
                    developed a deep understanding of human behavior and motivation, which I bring to every project I
                    work on. I am always thinking about the user experience and how I can create designs that are both
                    aesthetically pleasing and intuitive to use.

                    <br>In addition to my passion for design, I am also a writer and avid reader. I believe that
                    storytelling is at the heart of great design, and I love to explore how words and images can work
                    together to create a powerful narrative. Whether I am creating a brand identity, a website, or a
                    social media campaign, I always strive to tell a story that will engage and connect with my
                    audience.

                    <br>As an empathetic person, I am deeply committed to creating designs that are inclusive,
                    accessible, and respectful of diverse perspectives. I believe that design has the power to bring
                    people together and create positive change in the world, and I am excited to be part of a community
                    of designers who share this vision.

                    <br>Overall, I am a curious, creative, and empathetic person who is passionate about design and its
                    ability to make a difference in the world. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities
                    to learn, grow, and create, and I can't wait to see where my journey as a designer takes me next.
